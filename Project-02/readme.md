# BMI Calculator Project

## Introduction
This project is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator designed to help users estimate their body mass index based on their weight and height. BMI is a widely used indicator of body fatness and can be helpful in assessing potential health risks associated with weight.

- **BMI Calculation:** The calculator will compute the BMI using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2.
- **Result Interpretation:** The result will be interpreted based on standard BMI categories, indicating whether the user is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and intuitive user interface for a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used
